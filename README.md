## Overview
SEA-HELM (SouthEast Asian Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) is an assessment of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks, emphasizing Southeast Asian languages. This suite consist of 5 core pillars - NLP Classics, LLM-specifics, SEA Linguistics, SEA Culture and Safety - which evaluates the performance of LLMs across a range of key capabilities in the SEA languages.

Results from SEA-HELM can be found on the SEA-HELM leaderboard at [https://leaderboard.sea-lion.ai/](https://leaderboard.sea-lion.ai/).

## Evaluating Models using SEA-HELM

### Setup environment for SEA-HELM
1. Install the virtual environment using `requirements.txt`
2. Ensure that the appropriate HF_TOKEN has been set in the environment (with access to gated models).

> [!NOTE]  
> **Running LLM-as-a-Judge for MT-bench**  
> SEA-HELM currently uses `gpt-4-1106-preview` as the Judge LLM. As such, there is a need to access the OpenAI servers. Please ensure that `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set.
>
> ```
> export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
> ```

> [!NOTE]  
> **Translation evaluation using deep learning based models**  
> To run the evaluation with MetricX models please ensure that you have access to the following MetricX models on Huggingface.
> - MetricX-24 (XXL, bfloat16): https://huggingface.co/google/metricx-24-hybrid-xxl-v2p6-bfloat16


### Instructions for running SEA-HELM
<details open>

<summary><strong>Option 1: Running SEA-HELM using vLLM from the CLI</strong></summary>

SEA-HELM can be run using the following bash command by replacing
1. `<model_name>` with the desired huggingface model id or a local folder containing a huggingface model
1. `<output_dir>` with the local folder to save the run config and results

The command will run inference on the desired model with vLLM using a single gpu.
> ```bash
> python seahelm_evaluation.py --tasks seahelm --output_dir <output_dir> --model_type vllm --model_name <model_name> --model_args "dtype=bfloat16,enable_prefix_caching=True,tensor_parallel_size=1"
> ```
</details>

> [!TIP]  
> `--model_args` takes any kwargs specified in [https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/engine_args.html](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/engine_args.html) and allows for control of how vLLM serves the model

<details>

<summary><strong>Option 2: Running using the provided bash script</strong></summary>

To run the evaluation:
1. Specify the path to the output directory (for the model generations, results JSON and log files) as well as the models to be evaluated in `run_evaluation.sh`
1. Then run the evaluation with the following command:

```bash
bash run_evaluation.sh
```

This sets up a screen screen running the SEA-HELM evaluation python script
</details>

> [!TIP]  
> You may use `screen -R {SESSION_NAME}` to attach to the screen running the evaluation to view the progress (session name will be printed out when the script is run).

### Important notes about running SEA-HELM
  
1. Please ensure that the `--base_model` flag is included if the model to be evaluated is a base model. This will load a default base model chat template (see `chat_templates\base_model.jinja`). The `--base_model` will also disable the MT-Bench tasks.
1. All inference results are cached in the results folder to allow for resumption of incomplete runs. If there is a need to rerun the inference, please either delete the corresponding model folder in the results folder or set the flag `--rerun_cached_results`
1. LLM-as-a-Judge in SEA-MT-Bench
    1. The OpenAI calls are currently performed using the OpenAI's Batch API to save cost. This might result in a small increase in the wait times depending on the load of the OpenAI servers.
    1. If present as a task to run, MT-Bench is run as the first task so as to allow for the judgements to be done while the rest of the evaluations are being done.

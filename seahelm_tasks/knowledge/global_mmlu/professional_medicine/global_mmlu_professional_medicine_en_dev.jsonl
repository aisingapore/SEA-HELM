One month ago, he received care in the emergency department for pain over his right flank following a motor vehicle collision. At that time, blood pressure was 160\/100 mm Hg and CT scan of the abdomen showed an incidental 10-cm left adrenal mass.

The patient was referred to a surgeon, who recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6°C (97.9°F), pulse 100\/min, respirations 14\/min, and blood pressure 170\/95 mm Hg.
